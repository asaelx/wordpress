# Asael Codes

This WordPress project leverages the powerful WooCommerce plugin to create a robust and scalable e-commerce platform designed for seamless online shopping experiences.
The site features a clean, user-friendly interface, responsive design for optimal viewing on all devices, and comprehensive product listings with detailed descriptions, high-quality images, and customer reviews.
Integration with secure payment gateways ensures safe transactions, while customizable shipping options enhance user convenience.

# Plugins used

I use a couple of plugins for optimization like

- Rank Math for better SEO configurations and AI features.
- WP Super Cache for better caching and improving the speed of the site.
- WP Optimize for database, images, caching and minify optimizations.

For the store I use:

- Woocommerce for the e-commerce.
- Woocommerce Stripe Gateway for credit/debit card payments.
- Woocommerce Paypal Payments for integration with Paypal.

I can add more payment gateways or even implement custom payments if needed.
